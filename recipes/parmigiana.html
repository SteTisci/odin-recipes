        <h3>Preparation</h3>
    
        <ul>
            <p>Step 1</p>
            <li>To prepare the parmigiana, start with the sauce. Clean and chop the onion, pour it into a pan where you have heated the oil (which covers the bottom). Let it brown for a couple of minutes, stirring frequently so as not to burn it, then add the tomato puree</li>
            <p>Step 2</p>
            <li>Season with salt and pour in the basil leaves, rinse the container with a little water and pour it into the pot then leave to cook over low heat for 45-50 minutes. In the meantime cut the fiordilatte into cubes keeping aside a piece that will be used at the end</li>
            <p>Step 3</p>
            <li>Drain the cubes in a colander placed in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside: this procedure is used to drain the excess whey</li>
            <p>Step 4</p>
            <li>At this point go to the eggplants, clean them and trim them. Slice lengthwise to obtain 4-5 mm thick slices. When you have finished fry the eggplants in already hot oil at 170°, dipping a few pieces at a time, as soon as they are lightly browned, drain them on a tray with absorbent paper</li>
            <p>Step 5</p>
            <li>When there is no more space on the tray, put more absorbent paper and put the other fried eggplants to drain. Finally, move on to the composition, start by pouring a little sauce into a 20x30 cm baking dish</li>
            <p>Step 6</p>
            <li>Form the first layer by arranging the eggplants slices, pour the tomato sauce, spread it and distribute some fiordilatte cubes</li>
            <p>Step 7</p>
            <li>Sprinkle with the grated Parmesan and some basil leaves. Start again by adding the tomato sauce and the eggplants, which will be placed in the opposite direction</li>
            <p>Step 8</p>
            <li>And then again the 22 cheeses and the basil leaves. Continue like this until you reach the last layer of eggplants and which you are going to season, once again, with the sauce and the fiordilatte you have kept aside, to be broken up by hand</li>
            <p>Step 9</p>
            <li>Finish with the grated Parmesan and bake in a static oven, already hot at 200°, for about 30 minutes. Once the cooking time has elapsed, let it rest for 15-20 minutes before serving your parmigiana</li>
        </ul>
