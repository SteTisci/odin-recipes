        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mascarpone cheese </strong> 750 g</li>
            <li><strong>Savoiardi biscuits</strong> 250 g</li>
            <li><strong>Coffe </strong> 300 g</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs </strong> 260 g</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar </strong> 120 g</li>
            <li><strong>Bitter cocoa </strong> to taste</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
    
        <ul>
            <p>Step 1</p>
            <li>To prepare the tiramisu, prepare the coffee with the mocha to obtain 300 g, then sugar to taste (we put a teaspoon) and let it cool in a low, large bowl. Separate the eggs by dividing the whites from the yolks, remembering that to beat well the whites must not have any trace of yolk. Whip the egg yolks with an electric whisk, pouring only half the dose of sugar. As soon as the mixture has become clear and frothy, and with the whisk still running, you can add the mascarpone, little by little</li>
            <p>Step 2</p>
            <li>Once all the cheese has been incorporated, you will have obtained a dense and compact cream; keep it aside. Clean the whisks very well and start beating the egg whites. When they are foamy, pour the remaining sugar a little at a time</li>
            <p>Step 3</p>
            <li>You will have to mount them in firm snow; you will get this result when by overturning the bowl the mass will not move. Take a spoonful of egg whites and pour it into the bowl with the mascarpone cream and mix vigorously with a spatula, thus diluting the mixture. Then proceed to add the remaining egg whites, little by little, mixing very gently from bottom to top</li>
            <p>Step 4</p>
            <li>The mascarpone cream is now ready. Distribute a generous spoonful of it on the bottom of a 30x19.5cm glass baking dish and distribute evenly over the entire base. Dip the ladyfingers for a few moments in the iced coffee, first on one side and then on the other</li>
            <p>Step 5</p>
            <li>Gradually distribute the soaked ladyfingers in the baking dish, trying to arrange them all in one direction, so as to obtain a first layer of biscuits. Add more mascarpone cream and level it so as to cover them completely</li>
            <p>Step 6</p>
            <li>Transfer the remaining cream into a sac-à-poche with a smooth 12 mm diameter spout and make tufts for the entire size of the pan. Sprinkle it with unsweetened cocoa powder and let it harden in the refrigerator for a couple of hours</li>
        </ul>
