    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Saffron pistils </strong> 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li><strong>Butter </strong> 125 g</li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan </strong> 80 g</li>
        <li><strong>Water </strong> to taste</li>
        <li><strong>Salt </strong> to taste</li>
        <li><strong>Carnaroli rice</strong> 320 g</li>
        <li><strong>Onion </strong> 1</li>
        <li><strong>White wine </strong> 40 g</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetable broth</strong> 1 liter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
            <p>Take the saffron and put it in a small glass, pour water on them just enough to cover the saffron completely, mix and leave to infuse overnight</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
            <p>Prepare the vegetable broth, for the recipe you will need a liter</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
            <p>Finely chop the onion so that it can melt during cooking and not be perceived while savoring the risotto</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong>
            <p>Into a large saucepan, pour 50g of butter taken from the total dose required, melt it over low heat, then pour the chopped onion and let it stew for 10-15 minutes adding some broth so as not to dry out the saut√©ed</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong>
            <p>Pour the rice and toast it for 3-4 minutes, so the grains will seal and keep cooking well. Deglaze with the white wine and let it evaporate completely</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong>
            <p>Proceed with cooking for about 18-20 minutes, adding the broth a ladle at a time, as needed, as it is absorbed by the rice</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 7</strong>
            <p>Five minutes before the end of cooking, pour the water with the saffron pistils that you had infused, mix to flavor and give the risotto a nice golden colour</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 8</strong>
            <p>Once cooked, turn off the heat, salt, stir in the grated cheese and the remaining 75 g of buttermix and cover with the lid, let it rest for a couple of minutes, at this point the Risotto alla Milanese is ready</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
